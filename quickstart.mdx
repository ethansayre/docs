## Our Engagements

All Givefront engagements begin with an introduction to your organization's new accountant point of contact. All Givefront CPAs and finance professionals are US-based and receive roughly 100 hours of training per year, through mediums that include conferences, CPE credits, seminars, and training materials as compliant with service operation control standards that are  established by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA).

### Onboarding Process

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="pen" title="Accounting Setup" defaultOpen="true">
    During the onboarding process, our staff will document your existing accounting and bookkeeping workflows. Per our finance professional's discretion, accounting and bookkeeping history may be moved to a platform that is better supported by Givefront professionals. A thorough review of Chart of Accounts, tracking systems, Monthly P&L, Balance Sheet, and Statement of Cash Flow reports will be conducted as part of our onboarding review process.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="calendar" title="Process and Procedure" defaultOpen="true">
   Our staff will develop a structured set of ongoing schedules, processes, and procedures to guide our bookkeeping and accounting engagement. Our finance professional will describe the processes and procedures, as well as the roles and responsibilities, of the interaction between our staff and yours with regard to the reconciliation of accounts, preparation of financial statements and reports, and necessary information and documentation that may be required from your organization throughout the engagement.

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
