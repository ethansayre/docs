## Bookkeeping Constructs and Definitions

The foundational components of any bookkeeping system involve maintaining records of changes in assets, liabilities, and net assets.

### Understanding Assets
Assets encompass all items of value owned by an organization. For a not-for-profit entity, examples of assets may include:

* Cash & Investments
* Vehicles
* Buildings
* Land
* Equipment & Tools
* Office Furniture
* Accounts Receivable (funds owed to the organization)
* Prepaid Expenses

<Tip>
Net assets represent the equity accumulated by the organization. This is determined by subtracting total expenses from total revenue annually and is tracked cumulatively from the organization’s inception. In a for-profit corporation, this figure would be termed profit or retained earnings.

### Understanding Liabilities
Liabilities refer to the obligations or debts that an organization owes. Examples of liabilities include:

* Loans/Notes Payable
* Vehicle Loans
* Equipment Loans

### The Ledger System

A ledger system is employed to accurately record transactions as they happen. An individual record for each transaction is known as an account. A complete set of accounts related to a particular organization is grouped into a ledger. Within this ledger, accounts are typically organized in the order they appear on financial statements and are categorized based on similar characteristics such as assets, liabilities, net assets, revenue, or expenses.

#### Adjusting Asset, Liability, and Net Asset Values

Bookkeeping commonly uses the abbreviations Dr. and Cr., short for debit and credit, in various business documents. It’s important to understand the following rules when preparing financial statements manually:

1. **Assets**: Positioned on the left-hand side of the balance sheet, assets increase with debits.
2. **Liabilities**: Situated on the right-hand side of the balance sheet, liabilities increase with credits.
3. **Net Assets**: Also on the right-hand side of the financial statement, net assets increase with credits.

Debits cause an increase in asset values, so a decrease is recorded with credits. Conversely, liabilities and net assets, which grow with credits, will decrease with debits.

In summary:
- Assets are increased by debits and reduced by credits.
- Liabilities grow with credits and diminish with debits.
- Net assets rise with credits and are lessened by debits.

#### T-Accounts - Managing Assets, Liabilities, and Net Assets

Changes in accounts are recorded as transactions happen. Each transaction requires at least one account to be debited and another credited. While multiple account balances may change with each transaction, the core bookkeeping equation, Assets = Liabilities + Net Assets, always remains balanced. This consistency is the cornerstone of double-entry bookkeeping, ensuring that debits always equal credits.


## Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements allows for the formal documentation of all corrections and adjustments previously made. These statements become part of the organization's permanent records.

### Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position)

The Statement of Financial Position, historically known as the Balance Sheet, integrates the three fundamental elements of bookkeeping: assets, liabilities, and net assets. It lists all assets owned by the organization and all claims against these assets as of a specific date. Claims consist of liabilities, held by creditors, and net assets, held by the organization itself. It is advisable to prepare this statement at the end of each month and fiscal year, aligning with the organization's accounting period, which may not coincide with the calendar year.

### Income Statement (Statement of Activities)

The Income Statement, now referred to as the Statement of Activities, details the organization's revenues, expenses, and the resultant change in net assets for the current fiscal period. Revenues are listed and totaled first, followed by expenses which are then subtracted from the total revenue to determine the net income, reflecting changes in net assets.

## Monthly Financial Monitoring

Organizations invest significant time and resources in ensuring their accounting systems and record-keeping processes facilitate effective fund collection and bill payment. However, many fail to allocate sufficient resources to monitor their financial health, which involves comparing actual expenditures against budgets.

Monthly financial monitoring is crucial for nonprofits as it provides early warnings of financial and other management issues before they escalate. Such regular assessments help inform board members, managers, and staff about the organization's fiscal health. The board of directors and management must determine the level of detail and complexity needed for their financial monitoring. A critical component of these reviews is the comparison of budgeted versus actual expenditures and revenues. This comparison, essentially an enhanced income statement, includes additional columns for budgeted figures and remaining balances for each line item.

Management uses this comparison to:
- Contrast actual year-to-date revenues and expenditures against budgeted amounts.
- Identify any discrepancies between the actual figures and the budget.
- Determine the causes of these variances.
- Formulate plans to address and rectify these variances if necessary.

In addition to the budget comparison, it is also recommended that the board reviews the balance sheet (Statement of Financial Position). 

Regular monthly reviews are vital, and it is equally important to develop and monitor an appropriate action plan based on these reviews. Our finance professionals will help you establish a monitoring system that is tailored to your organization's needs.

### Cash vs. Accrual Accounting

The availability of cash is crucial for maintaining the financial health of a nonprofit organization. Both board members and staff are keenly interested in the monthly cash availability to support the organization's mission. Owing to its simplicity, many nonprofits opt for the cash basis method of accounting. In this method, transactions are recorded only when there is an actual impact on cash accounts: revenue is recorded when funds are received or deposited, and expenses are recorded when bills are paid.

For nonprofits with minimal outstanding accounts payable or receivable, the cash basis method can accurately reflect the organization's financial status. However, this method does not account for non-cash transactions that may affect the bottom line. Consequently, a financial report showing a large cash balance might mislead management into a false sense of security, especially if invoices that have not yet been received are pending payment.

The accrual method of accounting, on the other hand, aligns financial information with the period in which it is incurred. Expenses are recorded when they occur, regardless of when the payment is made (e.g., ordering supplies or services rendered by consultants). Similarly, revenue is recognized when it is earned, regardless of when the funds are actually received (e.g., when services are delivered or grant conditions are fulfilled). This method provides a more comprehensive view of an organization’s finances over the fiscal year, allowing management to accurately assess whether the cash on hand is sufficient to cover incurred liabilities.

Many organizations employ a hybrid approach, recording expenses on an accrual basis using accounting software, while revenue is recorded on a cash basis as it is received. Some maintain their books on a cash basis during the year but convert them to accrual for reporting purposes, employing worksheets to illustrate necessary adjustments.

For compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), year-end audited financial statements must be prepared on an accrual basis. Often, organizations rely on their independent auditors to convert their books from cash to accrual basis as part of the annual audit process.

It is vital for both board members and management to understand the accounting methods underpinning their financial reports, enabling informed decision-making based on accurate financial information. Our finance staff will consult with you and discuss this decision with the context of previous financial statements, procedures, and norms.
