## Bookkeeping Constructs and Definitions

The foundational components of any bookkeeping system involve maintaining records of changes in assets, liabilities, and net assets.

### Understanding Assets
Assets encompass all items of value owned by an organization. For a not-for-profit entity, examples of assets may include:

* Cash & Investments
* Vehicles
* Buildings
* Land
* Equipment & Tools
* Office Furniture
* Accounts Receivable (funds owed to the organization)
* Prepaid Expenses

<Tip>
Net assets represent the equity accumulated by the organization. This is determined by subtracting total expenses from total revenue annually and is tracked cumulatively from the organization’s inception. In a for-profit corporation, this figure would be termed profit or retained earnings.

### Understanding Liabilities
Liabilities refer to the obligations or debts that an organization owes. Examples of liabilities include:

* Loans/Notes Payable
* Vehicle Loans
* Equipment Loans

### The Ledger System

A ledger system is employed to accurately record transactions as they happen. An individual record for each transaction is known as an account. A complete set of accounts related to a particular organization is grouped into a ledger. Within this ledger, accounts are typically organized in the order they appear on financial statements and are categorized based on similar characteristics such as assets, liabilities, net assets, revenue, or expenses.

#### Adjusting Asset, Liability, and Net Asset Values

Bookkeeping commonly uses the abbreviations Dr. and Cr., short for debit and credit, in various business documents. It’s important to understand the following rules when preparing financial statements manually:

1. **Assets**: Positioned on the left-hand side of the balance sheet, assets increase with debits.
2. **Liabilities**: Situated on the right-hand side of the balance sheet, liabilities increase with credits.
3. **Net Assets**: Also on the right-hand side of the financial statement, net assets increase with credits.

Debits cause an increase in asset values, so a decrease is recorded with credits. Conversely, liabilities and net assets, which grow with credits, will decrease with debits.

In summary:
- Assets are increased by debits and reduced by credits.
- Liabilities grow with credits and diminish with debits.
- Net assets rise with credits and are lessened by debits.

#### T-Accounts - Managing Assets, Liabilities, and Net Assets

Changes in accounts are recorded as transactions happen. Each transaction requires at least one account to be debited and another credited. While multiple account balances may change with each transaction, the core bookkeeping equation, Assets = Liabilities + Net Assets, always remains balanced. This consistency is the cornerstone of double-entry bookkeeping, ensuring that debits always equal credits.


## Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements allows for the formal documentation of all corrections and adjustments previously made. These statements become part of the organization's permanent records.

### Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position)

The Statement of Financial Position, historically known as the Balance Sheet, integrates the three fundamental elements of bookkeeping: assets, liabilities, and net assets. It lists all assets owned by the organization and all claims against these assets as of a specific date. Claims consist of liabilities, held by creditors, and net assets, held by the organization itself. It is advisable to prepare this statement at the end of each month and fiscal year, aligning with the organization's accounting period, which may not coincide with the calendar year.

### Income Statement (Statement of Activities)

The Income Statement, now referred to as the Statement of Activities, details the organization's revenues, expenses, and the resultant change in net assets for the current fiscal period. Revenues are listed and totaled first, followed by expenses which are then subtracted from the total revenue to determine the net income, reflecting changes in net assets.
