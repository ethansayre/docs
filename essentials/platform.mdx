## Givefront Platform

Bookkeeping and accounting is made easy with the Givefront platform, included in all engagements with us. The Givefront platform allows our staff and your organization's contacts to have enhanced federation and control over your financial accounts, transactions, and reporting requirements that are fulfilled by our finance professionals.

### Access

Access to the Givefront platform is supplied in our engagement letters. Givefront's platform is not made publicly accessible and platform access is restricted to current clients only.



<Tip>

All necessary **finance points of contact** and **board members** in your organization are eligible for complimentary Givefront account access.

</Tip>

### Onboarding

During the onboarding process, Givefront staff will advise your organization on which accounts are to be authorized and connected within the platform. Follow the account authorization and connection procedure that is described in the platform - this typically involves a redirection to your financial institution's website to sign in to accounts held in your organization's name, with a follow-on page that authorizes Givefront's staff and platform use of transaction data stored with your account.
  
The account connection procedure is central to the bookkeeping workflow - our platform is uniquely positioned to offer both of our staff a single and central view into the accounts that your organization may use on a daily basis.
