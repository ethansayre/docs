## Givefront Platform

Bookkeeping and accounting is made easy with the Givefront platform, included in all engagements with us. The Givefront platform allows our staff and your organization's contacts to have enhanced federation and control over your financial accounts, transactions, and reporting requirements that are fulfilled by our finance professionals.

### Access

Access to the Givefront platform is supplied in our engagement letters. Givefront's platform is not made publicly accessible and platform access is restricted to current clients only.



<Tip>

All necessary **finance points of contact** and **board members** in your organization are eligible for complimentary Givefront account access.

### Onboarding

During the onboarding process, Givefront staff will advise your organization on which accounts are to be authorized and connected within the platform. Follow the account authorization and connection procedure that is described in the platform - this typically involves a redirection to your financial institution's website to sign in to accounts held in your organization's name, with a follow-on page that authorizes Givefront's staff and platform use of transaction data stored with your account.
  
The account connection procedure is central to the bookkeeping workflow - our platform is uniquely positioned to offer both of our staff a single and central view into the accounts that your organization may use on a daily basis.

## Text Formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.

| Style         | How to write it   | Result          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/writing-content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

## Blockquotes

### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multiline

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```
