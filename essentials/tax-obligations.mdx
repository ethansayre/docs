## Tax Obligations for Nonprofit Organizations

Nonprofit organizations, while exempt from federal income tax, must comply with specific tax obligations to maintain their tax-exempt status and ensure transparency and accountability.

### Form 990 Series

The IRS requires tax-exempt organizations to file an annual return known as Form 990. The specific form used depends on the organization’s financial activity:
- **Form 990**: For nonprofits with gross receipts greater than \$200,000 or total assets over \$500,000.
- **Form 990-EZ**: For organizations with gross receipts less than \$200,000 and total assets less than \$500,000.
- **Form 990-N (e-Postcard)**: For small organizations with gross receipts of \$50,000 or less.
  
These forms collect information about the organization's finances, activities, governance, and compliance with certain legal obligations. Form 990 serves not only as a federal tax return but also as a public document to inform the community about the organization’s operations, thus supporting transparency.

### Revenue Qualifiers

Nonprofits must meet certain revenue qualifiers to maintain their tax-exempt status. This includes generating income from activities that are substantially related to their mission. Income generated from unrelated business activities, which exceed certain thresholds, can be subject to unrelated business income tax (UBIT). Managing this requires careful planning to ensure that unrelated business activities do not jeopardize the organization’s tax-exempt status.

### State-Specific Obligations

In addition to federal tax obligations, nonprofits may be subject to state and local taxes, including sales and use taxes, property taxes, and state income taxes, depending on the state in which the organization operates. Many states require additional filings separate from the IRS requirements, such as annual reports and registration with a state charity official.

### Compliance and Penalties

Failure to comply with tax filing requirements can result in penalties, including fines and the potential revocation of tax-exempt status. It is crucial for nonprofits to adhere to all filing deadlines and regulations to avoid such penalties. Regular audits and reviews can help ensure compliance with all applicable tax laws and regulations. All Givefront engagements are inclusive of local, state, and federal compliance requirement preparation and filings.

## Maintaining Compliance

To maintain compliance and ensure the longevity of their tax-exempt status, nonprofit organizations should engage in regular reviews of their tax-related practices. Many organizations opt to volunteer their books for auditing; our finance professionals may recommend for an audit on the basis of the revenue and operations of your organization, in addition to obligations that may be required depending on the locale of your organization.
