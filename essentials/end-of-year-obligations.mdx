## EOY Close

At the end of each fiscal year, it is standard practice to close all revenue and expense accounts. These accounts provide information for a specific fiscal period and should not carry over into the next. The balances from these accounts, which reflect changes in net assets, are transferred to the net asset account on the balance sheet to update it for the new fiscal period. Once closed, these accounts are reset to a zero balance for use in the upcoming fiscal year.

### Revenue and Expense Summary

To close an account, an entry equal to the account's balance is made, which results in a posting on the opposite side of the account. This closing procedure zeroes out all revenue and expense accounts. Revenue accounts, which hold credit balances, are debited to bring their balances to zero. The corresponding credit is made to the Revenue and Expense Summary account, which is used to aggregate the changes from income and expenses for the period.

The second entry zeroes out the expense accounts, which have debit balances, by crediting them. The debited counterpart is again the Revenue and Expense Summary account. The final closing entry zeroes out the balance of the Revenue and Expense Summary account, which equals the net income or loss for the period. This adjusts the Net Asset account on the balance sheet by either increasing it by the amount of net income or decreasing it by the amount of net loss incurred during the period. Our staff will walk you through their completion of this process and explain what it means for your organization.

### Accounts Closed/Accounts Open Ruling, Balancing

Accounts that are closed show zero balances. These include all revenue, expense, and summary accounts, which are totaled, and double-lined to indicate closure. This ruling method is applied to all ledger accounts at the end of the fiscal period.

In contrast, Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position) accounts carry balances over to the next fiscal period. These accounts are balanced and ruled accordingly. The steps taken are:
1. Verification of the ledger footings to prepare for a trial balance.
2. Entry of the balance amounts in ink on the smaller side with a check mark to indicate balance.
3. Writing of total amounts at the same line level on both debit and credit sides, and double-ruling through the date and money columns.
4. Recording of the account balance on the larger side as of the first day of the next fiscal period, marked as "Balance."

To confirm the equality of debits and credits after these procedures, a Post-Closing Trial Balance is prepared. This trial balance lists the same balances shown on the balance sheet but updates the net asset account for any net increases or decreases during the fiscal period. This marks the final step in the bookkeeping cycle for each fiscal period. Again - rest assured that our staff will be completing this process for you and explain its impact on your organization's financial standing.
